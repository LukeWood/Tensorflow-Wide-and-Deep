    "## Dataset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we chose the Census-Income-MLD dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository due to nature of the set being exactly what we needed. The set has both categorical and integer data, a large number of attributes (40), and a very large number of instances (approximately 300,000). Not only that, but the data is also very applicable and highly wanted in our society.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The dataset's goal is to be able to predict whether a person, based on the values of their attributes, is under or over the 50k income bar. However, our goal for this report is not simply just accuracy. We are placing much heavier emphasis on catching false negatives in the over 50k limit section. The reason for this choise falls under the logic of marketing and advertising. Since the census is public knowledge, advertising companies tend to use it to be able to predict their target market and where they are most likely to have an affect. \n",
    "   \n",
    "One target for these companies are individuals who make more than the average amount for they have more money to spend. If an advertiser is given a list that is missing a good deal of >50k individuals, they are also missing out on potential profit. This is something that our report will prioritize in order for a situation like that to be avoided.\n"
